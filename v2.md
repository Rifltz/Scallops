# Version 2.0.0 patch notes

This is actually going to be how I remind myself of what to do.
- Make flags for what error text displays
- Fix quitting state to include saving
- Fix sliders, they don't work


## Accessibility
- Added colour blind toggles for Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia

## Optimization
- Made loading times better by using parent classes for objects

## Content
- Added x puzzle
- Added new quitting flavour text (like the stuff you see on the Minecraft title screen!)
