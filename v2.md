# Version 2.0.0 patch notes

dimensions: 1024x768
This is actually going to be how I remind myself of what to do.
- Make flags for what error text displays
- Fix quitting state to include saving
- fix quitting screen to begin with
- use animal crossing fishing noises

actual game content:
- fishing minigame: don't catch the glitchy fish!
^this is all that remains to the game
- the game ends once you lift the anchor, which drains the sea
- at that point, you can pull a cord that was hidden below the water


## Accessibility
- Added colour blind toggles for Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia

## Optimization
- Made loading times better by using parent classes for objects

## Content
- Added x puzzle
- Added new quitting flavour text (like the stuff you see on the Minecraft title screen!)
