# Version 2.0.0 patch notes

dimensions: 1024x768
This is actually going to be how I remind myself of what to do.
- Make flags for what error text displays
- use animal crossing fishing noises

actual game content:
- fishing minigame: don't catch the glitchy fish!
^this is all that remains to the game
- the game ends once you lift the anchor, which drains the sea
- at that point, you can pull a cord that was hidden below the water

# fishing minigame structure
three phases:
- luring
- snag
- reeling

so really two phases because snag is part of luring

status of these should be controlled by FISHING event
fishing should change accordingly
  I think that means I give it a status variable

fishing(status, active_save, fish_list)

## luring

the downtime period
you just have to wait for rng to bless you
should take at most around 10 seconds
maybe don't make it check every 60 seconds, that might be too long
at any time the player can click the mouse and prematurely reel the line in

## snag

this is going to be a True/False toggle
give a 1-second window to react to the snag
make use of another clock for these, I think
if they miss, just start back at luring

## reeling
actual minigame, copy from stardew valley
use v as measure for stability bar, increase and decrease v while letting x change in accordance
hover mouse over rectangle, make sure rect.collidepoint is always active
the player probably shouldn't have to hold the mouse at this point

## Accessibility
- Added colour blind toggles for Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia

## Optimization
-Improved loading times by utilizing parent classes

## Content

  - as well as other kinds of seafood

  - Added page scrolling functionality in the "continue game" screen to support this addition
