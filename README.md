# Scallops
A game about a blob on a boat. However, not everything functions as it should...

## Cool stuff
This game doesn't function like your typical game.
You'll *need* to restart the program, not just play it as normal.

Dig around, see what you can find.

## Play it

The game is fine to be installed anywhere.\
Just unzip the package somewhere (preferably in its own folder) and the game will manage the rest.

## Bug terrarium

There are no bugs, they all died :(

## Cheats

Scrolling to the bottom of the Settings page and clicking the "Crash" button lets you quit the game without saving.\
Sometimes useful.
