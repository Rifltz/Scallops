# Game
It's a cool game. Play it.

# Gaming
This game doesn't function as normal. You'll *need* to restart the program, not just play it as normal. Dig around, see what you can find.

Even explore the file system, because you'll never know what you might see....

# Gamer
There are some rules, but the game doesn't exist yet so there are no rules to adhere to at the moment
