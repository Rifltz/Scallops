# Scallops
A game about fishing on a tropical island. However, not everything functions as it should...\
Well, for one thing, there are only scallops.\
\
Just don't break anything.

## Cool stuff
This game doesn't behave like your normal game.\
Sometimes, it'll crash. Don't worry: that's supposed to happen.\
Just reboot the game, and keep playing.

## Play it

The game is fine to be installed anywhere.\
Just unzip the package somewhere (preferably in its own folder) and the game will manage the rest.

## Bug terrarium

Depending on your hardware, the main menu might lag a bit.\
I tried to mitigate as much as possible, but it could still be a problem for you.

## Cheats

Scrolling to the bottom of the Settings page and clicking the "Crash" button lets you quit the game without saving.\
Sometimes useful.

The entire game revolves around fishing up the glitched scallops.\
Thus, if you just want to get through the content quickly, keep adding "glitch_scallop" into the fish array of your save file and rebooting the game.
