# Scallops

A game about fishing on a tropical island. However, not everything functions as it should...\
Well, for one thing, there are only scallops.\
\
Just don't break anything.

## Cool stuff

What a nice fishing simulator!\
There are just three parts to it:

### Lure

Wait patiently for a fish to nibble on your hook. It could take a while....

### Snag

There's the bite! Quickly click the mouse or press spacebar in time to snag it good onto your hook!

### Reel

Now hold on for dear life and follow the fish's movement! Keep the brown inside the green and tire the fish out.


Sometimes, the game will crash. Don't worry: that's supposed to happen.\
Just reboot the game, and keep playing.\
(Unfortunately, as it stands, the crashes don't serve any purpose because I didn't have enough time to flesh out a story. Sorry)

## Play it

The game is fine to be installed anywhere.\
Just unzip the package somewhere (preferably in its own folder) and the game will manage the rest.

## Bug terrarium

Depending on your hardware, the main menu might lag a bit.\
I tried to mitigate as much as possible, but it could still be a problem for you.

## Cheats

Scrolling to the bottom of the Settings page and clicking the "Crash" button lets you quit the game without saving.\
Sometimes useful.

There's really not much to see in the game, just try out the save file system and have fun fishing. Not much else.
